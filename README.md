# Exploring non-Euclidean spaces in Unreal Engine 4

The purpose of this project is to create a multi-level demonstration of non-Euclidean concepts to deepen understanding of some non-Euclidean properties which can be applied
in a game-like setting. Non-Euclidean geometry is achieved thanks to two core designs I created in Unreal Engine: a portal system and a 4D gallery. The portal system skews
the playerâ€™s perception of space by projecting an altered image on the portal the player is looking into while the 4D gallery creates an illusion of more objects occupying the same finite space.
